# Sandwich Delivery App – Mixpanel Product Analytics

This repository showcases a hypothetical **Sandwich Delivery App** analyzed using **Mixpanel**. The data is synthetic (provided by Product School) and demonstrates how product analytics can reveal key insights about user behavior, acquisition, retention, and A/B testing outcomes.

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Understand user engagement, acquisition patterns, and retention drivers for a fictional sandwich delivery app.
- **Data**: Synthetic data designed to mimic real-world user interactions (ordering, rating, payment methods, etc.).
- **Tools**: [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), spreadsheets (optional), and basic data manipulation scripts.

## Key Analyses
1. **User Behavior**  
   - Tracked events like sandwich orders, ratings, payment adjustments, and “favoriting” sandwiches.  
   - Created an *Engagement Score* to measure user activity based on these events.

2. **Acquisition Metrics**  
   - Examined funnels to see where potential customers dropped off.  
   - Noted a surprising pattern: users who hit 15 orders consistently gave perfect ratings.

3. **Retention Insights**  
   - Compared retention curves for users with and without food allergies.  
   - Found that allergic users churned at higher rates around weeks 2–3.

4. **A/B Testing**  
   - Tested three new payment methods (1-click, automatic billing, Apple Pay) against a control group.  
   - Identified which payment method provided the smoothest checkout experience and highest conversion.

## How to Use
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. Review the **data** folder (if provided) or sample scripts that outline how synthetic events are generated.
3. Explore the **notebooks** or **scripts** (if included) for detailed analytics steps, queries, and insights.
4. Adjust or replicate the analytics process for your own project needs.

## Insights & Takeaways
- **Engagement** can be quantified by tracking critical user actions and combining them into an overarching metric.  
- **Acquisition** funnels highlight specific points where users are most likely to drop off.  
- **Retention** analysis reveals which user segments need more attention or specialized features.  
- **A/B Testing** demonstrates how small changes (like payment methods) can significantly impact user experience and conversion.
